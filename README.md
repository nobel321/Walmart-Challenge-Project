# Walmart-Challenge-Project:
This is a prototype of a pathfinding algorithm to give a visual representation of an aspect of the pathfinding algorithms that our idea would include to return an *optimal* and *personalized* path through the Walmart store to find products.

## Implementation Details:
- Imports: pygame, math, queue (PriorityQueue)   
- Pathfinding Algorithm: *A-Star Pathfinding Algorithm* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)  
- Comments on implementation are included in code

`Line 209-260 >> main function`

## Usage Details:
1. clone repository (`git clone https://github.com/<repo-name>/.git`)
>*To run code...*
2. open IDE/terminal prompt
3. find directory where code is
4. run code using `python nav_algorithm.py` for Linux/Mac or `python .\nav_algorithm.py` for Windows
>*To use program...*
5. select a single *grid tile*/node to set the starting point of the algorithm
6. select another single *grid tile*/node to set the ending point of the algorithm
7. left-click on touch pad or mouse to place barrier nodes
8. right-click on touch pad or mouse to delete barrier nodes
9. enter to begin algorithm
10. ENJOY!

## Colour Key (Legend):
```diff
Orange (ðŸŸ§) = starting point
Blue (ðŸŸ¦) = ending point
Red (ðŸŸ¥) = node check
Green (ðŸŸ©) = node check open
Purple (ðŸŸª) = best path
Black (â¬›) = barriers/closed nodes
White (â¬œ) = space/open nodes
```
